# BBC News Labs Coding Exercise

BBC News Labs wants to evaluate prospective journalists coding skills.
Hundreds of articles are published each day by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news).

As journalists, it's important to know how many people we have reached. Even more important is understanding details: how did people access the BBC? And when were we most or less read?

For this exercise, BBC News Labs selected a dataset of page views for a single article published on 15th October 2018 at 13:05 GMT.
