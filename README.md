# BBC News Labs Coding Exercise

BBC News Labs wants to evaluate journalists' coding skills.
Hundreds of articles are published each day by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news).

As journalists, it's important to know how many people we have reached. Even more important is understanding details: how did people access the BBC? And when were we most or less read?

For this exercise, BBC News Labs selected a dataset of page views for a single article published on 15th October 2018 at 13:05 GMT.

We have to answer two questions:

# Question 1 - Output the percentage of people visiting the page via a mobile phone or a tablet device
# Question 2 - Generate a text file containing a table listing the mean number of total page views during each hourly time period


### Installing

We are going to use Python to solve the exercises. Install Python 3.

Download the "Article-Devices.csv" from this Github repository. Place it in the same folder as your News Labs notebook.

Besides that, we'll only need:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame
